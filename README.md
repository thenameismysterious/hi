# Using service accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
For Service Account to work, you must set USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS="True" in config file or environment variables
Many thanks to [AutoRClone](https://github.com/xyou365/AutoRclone) for the scripts
**NOTE:** Using service accounts is only recommended while uploading to a team drive.
## Generating service accounts
Step 1. Generate service accounts [What is service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
---------------------------------
Let us create only the service accounts that we need. 
**Warning:** abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 sa allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by google. 

```
Note: 1 service account can copy around 750gb a day, 1 project can make 100 service accounts so that's 75tb a day, for most users this should easily suffice. 
```

`python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only`

A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the service accounts

NOTE: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys project_id
```

### Add all the service accounts to the Team Drive
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```
